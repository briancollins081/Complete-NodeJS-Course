The mode is a sequence of 3 octal numbers. The first/left-most number specifies the permissions for the owner. The second number specifies the permissions for the group. The last/right-most number specifies the permissions for others. For example, with a mode of 0o764, the owner (7) can read/write/execute, the group (6) can read/write and everyone else (4) can read only.
